Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset of the MechaCar were the Vehicle Length and the Ground Clearance.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear model can't be considered to be zero; as the p-value of 5.35x10-11 is lower than even an extreme level of significance. So the null hypothesis must be rejected. This means that the relationship between our variables and the miles per gallon is subject to more than random chance.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149. This means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. Therfore this multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
